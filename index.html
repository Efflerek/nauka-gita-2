                <p style="song-text">There's an old friend that<br/>
                I once heard say<br/>
                Something that touched my heart<br/>
                And it began this way</p>

                <p>I was born by the river<br/>
                In a little tent<br/>
                And just like the river<br/>
                I've been runnin ever since<br/>
                He said it's been a long time comin'<br/>
                But I know my change is gonna come <br/>
                Oh yeah</p>
                
                <p>He said it's been too hard livin'<br/>
                But I'm afraid to die<br/>
                I might not be if I knew<br/>
                What was up there<br/>
                Beyond the sky<br/>
                It's been a long, a long time comin'<br/>
                But I know my change has got to come<br/>
                Oh yeah</p>
                
                <p>I went, I went to my brother<br/>
                And I asked him, brother<br/>
                Could you help me, please?<br/>
                He said, good sister<br/>
                I'd like to but I'm not able<br/>
                And when I, when I looked around<br/>
                I was right back down<br/>
                Down on my bended knees<br/>
                Yes I was, oh</p>
                
                <p>There've been times that I thought<br/>
                I thought that I wouldn't last for long<br/>
                But somehow right now I believe<br/>
                That I'm able, I'm able to carry on<br/>
                I tell you that it's been along<br/>
                And oh it's been an uphill journey<br/>
                All the way<br/>
                But I know, I know, I know<br/>
                I know my change is gonna come</p>
                
                <p>Sometimes I had to cry all night long<br/>
                Yes I did<br/>
                Sometimes<br/>
                I had to give up right<br/>
                For what I knew was wrong<br/>
                Yes it's been an uphill journey<br/>
                It's sure's been a long way comin<br/>
                Yes it has</p>
                
                <p>It's been real hard<br/>
                Every step of the way<br/>
                But I believe, I believe<br/>
                This evenin' my change is come<br/>
                Yeah I tell you that<br/>
                My change is come</p>
